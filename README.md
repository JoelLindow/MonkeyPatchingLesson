# MonkeyPatchingLesson

Hey Everyone! Thanks for checking out this little lesson.

We're going to just touch the concept of "Monkey Patching (Guerilla Patching" or "Hot Patching" ruby classes. This also will toy with the very basic usage of `self`.

Feel free to clone it down and use it to play with, or just follow along with the YouTube lesson.
